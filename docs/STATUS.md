# Status

Last updated: 2026-08-13.

## Phase 0 — Repository analysis: done

`docs/UNIFIED_APP_ARCHITECTURE.md` complete. Canonical repo confirmed as
this one. Reviewed with the user; two clarifications incorporated (Anki
migration is one-time only, no ongoing interop; WK/JMDict ingestion must be
native and web-based, not routed through Anki).

## Phase 1 — Unified data model: done, verified

Added, purely additively (nothing existing was touched):

- `src/domain/types.ts` — `Source`, `VocabularyItem`, `SentenceVocabulary`,
  `Kanji`, `VocabularyKanji`, `StudyItem`, `FsrsState`, `Review`,
  `ReviewRating`, `ErrorClassification`.
- `src/domain/schemas.ts` — matching Zod schemas. Not yet part of
  `backupSchema` (deferred until these tables carry real data worth backing
  up).
- `src/db/database.ts` — Dexie schema v6, seven new empty stores
  (`sources`, `vocabularyItems`, `sentenceVocabulary`, `kanji`,
  `vocabularyKanji`, `studyItems`, `reviews`).
- `supabase/migrations/20260813000000_unified_study_model.sql` — matching
  Postgres tables, RLS (owner-only), and the existing
  `set_updated_at`/`bump_version`/`append_sync_event` triggers. **Applied to
  the live Supabase project** (2026-08-13, via Dashboard SQL Editor paste;
  ran clean, no errors).
- `supabase/tests/rls_expectations.md`, `supabase/README.md` — updated to
  document the new tables.
- `tests/migration.test.ts` — new test opens at schema v6 and round-trips a
  row through each new table.

**Verified**: `npm run check` (typecheck + vitest) — 123 passed, 2 skipped
(pre-existing, unrelated — the personal-export smoke test needs a private
CSV that isn't present), 0 failed. No existing test was modified.

**Code-reviewed** (medium-effort pass) before commit; three real findings, all
fixed: (1) RLS policies on `sentence_vocabulary`/`vocabulary_kanji`/`reviews`
now also verify referenced rows (`vocabulary_item_id`/`kanji_id`/
`study_item_id`/`sentence_id`) belong to the same owner, not just the row
being written — added `sync_private.owns_vocabulary_item`/`owns_kanji`/
`owns_study_item` helpers; `rls_expectations.md` corrected (it previously
claimed protection that didn't exist). `study_items.subject_id` ownership is
a documented, accepted gap (polymorphic, can't be a plain FK). (2)
`kanjiSchema.character` now checks Unicode code points, not UTF-16 length,
so astral-plane kanji (e.g. 𠮟) validate consistently with Postgres's
`char_length`. (3) `SentenceVocabulary`/`VocabularyKanji` TS types were
missing `createdAt`/`updatedAt` that the SQL tables already have — added.

**Deliberately not done yet** (documented, not forgotten):
- Sync engine wiring (`src/sync/mappers.ts`, `SyncEntity`) for the new
  tables — no UI writes to them yet, so there's nothing to sync.
- `backupSchema`/`buildBackupPayload` extension to cover the new tables.

## Phase 2 onward: not started

See `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
