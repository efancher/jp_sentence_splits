# Status

Current-state snapshot. For the chronological blow-by-blow (files touched,
test counts, code-review findings, production-run logs) see
`docs/STATUS_ARCHIVE.md` and git history. For the feature-oriented
reference see `docs/AI_OVERVIEW.md`; for the at-a-glance phase list see
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Last updated: 2026-08-31.

## Where things stand

The original roadmap (Phases 0–9) is complete. All numbered phases plus
the later standalone efforts (Learning Orchestrator, re-segmentation,
vocabulary glossing, WaniKani mnemonics, contextual conjugation cards,
progressive listening, grammar-learning system Phases 1–9-slice) are
shipped and, in almost every case, verified against production data by the
user directly. Roughly 68 Python / ~1066 TS test files, green.

Active work is **Mining pipeline v2** — the last remaining roadmap item.
Its three quality slices (A: ASR transcript, B: full UniDic
form/reading/accent, C: retained source audio) and the staged wizard
(W1–W6) all landed 2026-08-31. What's left is deferred polish (below).

## Recent changes

(New detail lands here; swept into `STATUS_ARCHIVE.md` next time this file
is trimmed.)

- **2026-08-31 — Mining: JMnedict proper-noun reading cross-check.**
  `morphology.tokenize_japanese` consults a shipped ~220k-name table
  (`app/data/name_readings.json.gz`, built by `npm run build:name-readings`
  from JMnedict — person names with exactly one reading) and overrides a
  固有名詞 token's reading when UniDic-lite disagrees, dropping the stale
  UniDic accent (Kanjium fills it post-hoc). `MINING_NAME_READING_CHECK=0`
  off. Closes the last slice-B item. `test_morphology.py` +3 → 73 py.

- **2026-08-31 — Mining wizard deferred polish.** (1) `POST /jobs/{id}/commit`
  clips every reviewed row in one request with audio inline (base64) — the
  wizard's commit stage was a per-row clip+fetch loop. (2) `POST
  /source-audio/range` streams one span of a cached source; `/books/:id/resegment`
  now shows the boundary-drag waveform when the book has a `sourceUrl`
  (`ResegmentSourceContext.sourceUrl` → `fetchSourceAudioRange`). (3) Per-row
  `SpanAudioButton` on the segment + translate stage rows. (4) The
  translate stage's "Auto-fill (AI)" groups rows by transcript-segment
  provenance (`buildMiningRealignGroups`) instead of one whole-span group.
  `test_jobs_api.py`/`test_source_cache.py` +2, `miningApi.test.ts` +2,
  `resegmentPlan.test.ts` +1. 70 py / ~1074 ts. Redeployed. Still not
  browser-verified.

- **2026-08-31 — Pitch-accent H/L marks on the sentence.**
  `src/lib/sentencePitchAccent.ts` (`buildSentencePitchAccents`) +
  `src/components/SentencePitchAccentRow.tsx` render a per-word
  high/low-per-mora contour ("H"/"L" letters under the kana, plus a
  following-particle mark) for the confirmed sentence vocabulary that
  carries Kanjium/UniDic accent data. Deliberately per-word, not a joined
  sentence contour (no compound/cross-word accent computation — same
  stance as `pitchAccentRules.ts`); particles and dataless words are left
  unmarked, and the row renders nothing when a sentence has no accented
  words. Wired into `SyncedShadowText` (ShadowPage + guided
  ProgressiveShadowingPanel), `AnalysisPanel`'s pitch-accent section, and
  the `pitch_accent` review-card reveal (highlighting the card's target
  word). `tests/sentencePitchAccent.test.ts` (4). Not browser-verified
  (no browser libs in the sandbox) — typecheck/lint/build/1071 tests green.

## Phase completion

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| 0 — Repository analysis | done |
| 1 — Unified data model | done, verified; migration live 2026-08-13 |
| 2 — Existing data migration | done (WK kanji catalog + one-time Anki import run against prod; JMDict scoped to a local lookup tool) |
| 3 — Unified shadowing | done; live overlay/analysis delivered later under Phase 8 |
| 4 — FSRS | done; real activity-type differentiation delivered under Phase 7 |
| 5 — Vocabulary/kanji relationships | materialization + browsing UI done; part 2 (JMDict backfill + retroactive materialization) run against prod 2026-08-15 |
| 6 — Anki interoperability cleanup | done; `efancher/anki` archived, no export-back planned |
| 7 — Adaptive learning | done, all slices 7.1–7.11, verified against prod |
| 8 — Shadowing feature parity | done, all slices 8.1–8.5, browser-verified |
| 9 — Shadowing pronunciation/prosody feedback | done, all 9 milestones |
| Learning Orchestrator | done; daily-session model, vocab-confirm priority |
| Re-segment an existing source | done; run against "After Work" 2026-08-29 |
| Vocabulary meaning glossing | done; JMDict/JMnedict offline + `vocab-assist` Edge Function |
| WaniKani mnemonics | done, deployed 2026-08-29/30/31 (vocab + kanji + subject cache) |
| Contextual conjugation cards | done; migration live 2026-08-30 |
| Progressive listening (`word_listening`) | done 2026-08-30 |
| Mining pipeline v2 | slices A/B/C + wizard W1–W6 + polish + JMnedict reading check done 2026-08-31; one durability item deferred |

Phase-by-phase detail is in `docs/STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`; the ROADMAP entries
carry a one-paragraph summary each.

## Open / deferred

**Mining pipeline v2 — one item still deferred** (everything else —
wizard W1–W6, batch commit, per-row audio, resegment-page waveform,
provenance-grouped realign, JMnedict proper-noun reading check — landed
2026-08-31):
- Durability-only: a `source_audio` Supabase table + Storage mirror so the
  LRU source-audio cache can restore without re-hitting YouTube. Blocked on
  a decision — the Python service deliberately has no Supabase creds, so
  restore-from-Storage needs either a public read path or the client
  proxying the restore. (Recommendation on file: enable box-level backups
  of the cache dir instead; if building anyway, do upload-only and defer
  auto-restore.)

**Not yet browser-verified** (typecheck/build/tests green, and the sandbox
has no browser system libs):
- Mining wizard W1–W6 (covered by integration tests + build + typecheck).
- Contextual conjugation cards (`sentence_transformation` rework).
- Progressive listening `word_listening` cards.

**Data / content backlog:**
- **Review new-card backlog** — ~193 confirmed vocab words have no SRS
  card; the planner can't see the backlog, seeds too slowly, and the
  session review step can auto-complete before the queue drains. Needs a
  planner fix, not just a one-off seed.
- **Auto-caption fragmentation re-mine** — pre-2026-08-23 shadowing
  imports (After Work, First Day at Work, GLIM SPANKY) were systemically
  mis-segmented (auto-captions, no punctuation). Bulk re-mine through the
  new ASR pipeline is planned, not done.
- **Pitch-accent gaps** — after Kanjium + UniDic gap-fill, ~79
  `vocabulary_items` still have no `pitch_accent_positions`.
- **4 noun homograph pairs** left with two live readings each (何 なに/なん,
  羽 はね/わ, 話 はなし/わ, 後 あと/ご) — both valid; user is waiting to see
  if the duplication is annoying in practice before merging.

**Infra:**
- Mac Tailscale exit node for mining downloads still TODO (phone verified
  working 2026-08-30; datacenter mining box is YouTube bot-blocked, so
  downloads route through a personal-device exit node).

**Larger not-started items (deliberate, reasoning in the archive):**
- Cross-sentence shadowing learner profile (Phase 9's one still-open
  milestone; brief's Phase 15).
- Audio-less pitch-accent production/recording drill mode (practice pitch
  accent on Satori sentences that have no reference audio) — distinct from
  the shipped passive `pitch_accent` SRS card.
- PASQA speech-quality model — architecture left ready; blocked on
  PyTorch+s3prl footprint on the memory-constrained analysis host.

## Services

- `server/youtube-mining` (FastAPI, `systemctl --user`, this repo) — mining
  pipeline, `/resegment`, `/reclip`, source-audio cache, job wizard.
- `~/projects/shadowing-analysis-api` (separate repo, Hetzner box,
  `systemd --user`, tailnet-only via `tailscale serve`) — MFA forced
  alignment, `faster-whisper` ASR (`base` diagnostic + `large-v3-turbo`
  source transcription).
- Supabase — single shared project, table-prefix-isolated from the retired
  `shadowing` repo. Always soft-delete synced tables (`deleted_at`), never
  raw `DELETE`, or clients never learn of the change.
- Edge Functions — `grammar-assist`, `vocab-assist` (Claude Haiku).
